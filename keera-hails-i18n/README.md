This convenience library lets applications use a file to configure language
preference. It also gives functions to pick up the appropriate Gettext
files for the chosen language upon application start.

Although part of Keera Hails, this library does not depend on Reactive Values
and can be used independently. It also does not require using a GUI of any
kind.

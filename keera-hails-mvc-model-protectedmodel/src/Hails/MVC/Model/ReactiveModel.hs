-- | This module holds a reactive program model. It holds a program model, but
-- includes events that other threads can listen to, so that a change in a part
-- of the model is notified to another part of the program. The reactive model
-- is not necessarily concurrent (it doesn't have its own thread), although a
-- facility is included to make it also concurrent (so that event handlers can
-- be called as soon as they are present).
--
-- This type includes operations to handle undoing-redoing and
-- tracking which notifications must be triggered in each
-- undo-redo step.

-- | A reactive model uses an event datatype with all the events that our model
-- must trigger. An heterogenous container cannot be used because we need an Eq
-- operation that is efficient (a string comparison is not).
--
-- Therefore, we can declare operations that require certain events,
-- as long as we create a typeclass for Event types that have a constructor
-- for the kind of events we require. This reactive model handles Undo/Redo
-- internally, and changes to the undo-stack are notified automatically.
-- All Event types must declare an undo event, even if it's not used.
--
-- NOTE: This is experimental code. Undo/Redo support may not be necessary in
-- many programs, and another Reactive Model definition could be provided with
-- no support for undo-redo if this bothers you too much.

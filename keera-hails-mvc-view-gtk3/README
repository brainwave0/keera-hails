MVC applications are structured as a model, a view and a controller.

This package contains a Gtk+ implementation of keera-hails-mvc-view, an abstract
interface for views in MVC applications. Keera Hails Views can be seen as
collections of Reactive Values, which is sufficient to specify controller
reactive rules and connections to the model in a GUI-agnostic way.

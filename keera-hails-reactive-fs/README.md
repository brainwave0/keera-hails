This library includes functions to turn a file into a reactive value.

There are two functions: one to create a reactive value (one that notifies of
changes to the file, regardless of their origin) and one to create a passive
(reactive) value (one that acts as a source/sink, but whose changes are not
notified). The latter is useful as a destination of information, for instance,
or as a source when combined with a reactive value (see governance in Hails).

This code is part of Keera Hails (a Haskell on (Gtk+) rails library).

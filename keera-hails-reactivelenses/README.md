Reactive Values combined with Lenses
====================================

Lenses allow you to focus on a specific part of a reactive value. When
you have a lens, you can use it to turn a reactive value into another that
represents only a subpart of your original structure.

Reactive Values
===============

Reactive values are a form of mutable, reactive, thread-safe memory locations.
They are great to create reactive anchors in your GUI and your model, and then
write declarative rules that bridge them together during runtime.

Support

Open a ticket or send me a message if you use this and have a problem.

Also, I'd be happy to know (and publish a list of) programs that use
hails-reactivevalues. Please, let me know if you write something that uses it.

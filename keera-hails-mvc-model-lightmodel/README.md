This library enabled creating (lightweight) protected models that can be used
with the reactive programming library Hails.

Protected models are mutable variables that can only be accessed in a
thread-safe manner via a specific API, and whose changes you can listen to.
Protected models are meant to contain the model of an application in MVC, so
that one can later write reactive (synchronisation) rules.

See the rest of Keera's hails-* projects to know more about this.

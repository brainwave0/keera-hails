-- | This module contains a series of conditions that must hold between
-- the view and the model. Most of these conditions can be separated in
-- two conditions: one that must be checked only when the model changes
-- (and updates the view accordingly), and another that must be checked
-- when the view receives an event (and updates the model accordingly).

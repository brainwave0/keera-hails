This directory contains the minimal necessary files to create an application
with Keera Hails. Instead of just giving you the code, we are going to explain
how to build this application yourself using the features that keera-hails
provides.

# Step 1: create empty application template

```
$ export PATH=$PWD/.cabal-sandbox:$PATH
$ cabal v1-sandbox init
$ cabal v1-install keera-hails
$ hails --init --output-dir=src/
```

# Step 2: adjust local Paths module name

The app does not compile yet because the given template does not adjust the
imports of your packages autogenerated `Paths` module. Modify the file
`src/Custom/Paths` to import the `Paths` file specific to your application. In
the case of this demo app, the change can be made with:

```
$ sed -i -e 's/myapp/keera_hails_gtk_app/g' src/Paths/CustomPaths.hs
```

Afterwards, youur application should compile, but it will not do anything yet:

```
$ cabal v1-install
```

# Step 3: obtain and show the main window

Modify the following files to show the main application window included in the
file `data/Interface.glade`:

- `src/Controller.hs`: uncomment the imports and the command to show the main
  window. These changes are annotated with comments like the following:
  ```
  If you have a main window to show, uncomment the following:
  ```

- `src/View/Object.hs`: Uncomment the functions `onBuilder` and `mainWindow`.

Afterwards, you should be able to compile your application with:

```
$ cabal v1-install
```

And run it with:

```
./.cabal-sandbox/bin/keera-hails-gtk-app
```

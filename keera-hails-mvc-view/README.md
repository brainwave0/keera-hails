MVC applications are structured as a model, a view and a controller.

This package contains a basic interface for views that is agnostic with respect
to the backend. It should allow creating complete programs in which the controller
and the model are fully GUI independent.

GUIs can be seen as collections of Reactive Values, which is sufficient to specify
controller reactive rules and connections to the model in a GUI-agnostic way.

Reactive Values are mutable values with change propagation. They can be
composed to create new RVs, and linked together so that changes to one
propagate towards others.  Reactive Values are typed (by the type of the
contents and by their access properties); when they are connected, the type of
the contents must match and the access properties must be compatible.

This library contains functions to create RVs from Internet sockets, so
that messages written to the values are sent out the socket, and messages
read from the value are read from the socket. This allows connecting sockets
to other elements using Reactive Rules and defining a networked Reactive
application.
